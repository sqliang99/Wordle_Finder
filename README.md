# Wordle_Finder
An app that helps you filter words for wordle. If you ask for it you can also get an algorithm generated lucky word for you to try.

The list of wordle words are kindly provided by Cyrus Freshman. You can find it here: https://gist.github.com/cfreshman/a03ef2cba789d8cf00c08f767e0fad7b

This app is supported by streamlit and deployed on streamlit cloud, you can access it here: https://share.streamlit.io/sqliang99/wordle_finder/main/wordle_app.py

This project is partially inspired by 3blue1brown, although his video on information theory lost me half way.
